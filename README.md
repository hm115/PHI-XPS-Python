# PHI-XPS-Python

Run "Read and Plot XPS from spe.ipynb" with Jupyter Notebook, or Google Colab at your discretion.
Follow the instructions once open.

The "peak_deconvolution.ipynb" file is an attempt at generalizing the deconvolution method for any peak. It still uses the Shirley background algorithm, which uses assumptions centered around electron scattering relevant for XPS, so use it at you're own peril.

The other file is what I started with, so it is irrelevant to you unless you want to take a look.
